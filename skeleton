This is a non-trivial problem, and there are multiple ways to solve it, some simpler than others.    
Think about the problem in general, which is
Given a list of N numbers, with duplicates and a percentage K
Example: 100 values, with duplicates, and you want to find the 10% of those values that are the smallest values in the set.
Find the smallest value X such that there are M numbers less than or equal to X
Example: The smallest value in the set is 84.2%, and that value occurs 3 times.
M / N is greater than or equal to K
Example: 3/100 is not greater than or equal to 10% so repeat for the next smallest value:
The next smallest value is 84.5%, and that value occurs 2 times.
Now you have the 5 smallest values.
5/100 is still not greater than or equal to 10% so choose the next smallest value and repeat again.
Stop when your set of smallest values represents 10% or more of the total.
